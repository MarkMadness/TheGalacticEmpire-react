# The Galactic Empire - React

This project is a fan-made application on the idea that the Galactic Empire from Star Wars needed a React web application. This follows the style of Star Wars art and designing the application as it would accurately reflect the time of the Empire with concepts such as Imperial propoganda, patriotism of Imperial citizens, etc.

For the first part of this project I needed to design and build the homepage which would be the precident of the rest of the application's design. Here I have the Imperial icon in the background with a navbar and a quote from the Emperor Palpatine in his Declaration speech.

## MainNavbar Component

For the MainNavbar Component, which is meant for all first level pages throughout this React application, I wanted a transparent background with the nav elements z-index above the background image of the Imperial logo. From here the user can either select a nav menu or scroll down for further content on the main page. The content is soon to come!

## Footer Component

The Footer Component hold a nav menu for the less popular menues of visitors of the Galactic Empire. It contains a single navbar menu and a short few sentences at the bottom talking about the project. The CSS inherits the styling of the MainNavbar Component keeping consistency of style design.
