# The Galactic Empire - React

This project is a fan-made application on the idea that the Galactic Empire from Star Wars needed a React web application. This follows the style of Star Wars art and designing the application as it would accurately reflect the time of the Empire with concepts such as Imperial propoganda, patriotism of Imperial citizens, etc.

## Home Page

For the first part of this project I needed to design and build the homepage which would be the precident of the rest of the application's design. Here I have the Imperial icon in the background with a navbar and a quote from the Emperor, Palpatine, in his Declaration speech. 

Since the Imperial Empire is a militaristic society the first thing available to the user is a link to begin an application into the Imperial military. The same link will be in the military section of this web application, but because the major focus of The Galactic Empire is on the miltary, this app will give every chance for a user to apply.

Next is a section to report sedition or criminal activity which is also on the homepage because the Empire has a big focus on law and order in the galaxy and a loyal imperial citizen must perform their duty at the easiest convenience.

Last is the footer section which shares a small message from me to the user about the project and has links to less-priority links/pages to the website. One of those links is another careers section, but for non-military work. This is an interntional design to make the non-military jobs less likely to be found than the military jobs thus users are more likely to apply to the Imperial Military.

### MainNavbar Component

For the MainNavbar Component, which is meant for all first level pages throughout this React application, I wanted a transparent background with the nav elements z-index above the background image of the Imperial logo. From here the user can either select a nav menu or scroll down for further content on the main page. The content is soon to come!

### Footer Component

The Footer Component hold a nav menu for the less popular menues of visitors of the Galactic Empire. It contains a single navbar menu and a short few sentences at the bottom talking about the project. The CSS inherits the styling of the MainNavbar Component keeping consistency of style design.

## Law and Order - Bounty Board

The next section I worked on after the homepage was Law and Order. Starting off with the Bounty Board, I had the idea that the Empire would use bounty boards as a way to encourage citizens who encountered those who are wanted to report them to the authorities for a great reward. Another measure to enforce order in the galaxy. The image below is the first concept of the layout of the page where the bounties will be on display along with information about the money reward and a small synopsis of the target's description. While its not expected for citizens to actively seek out these targets, bounty hunters who work with the Empire on jobs will surely enjoy this page.
